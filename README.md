# Puppers üê∂

This app is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/jeanpaulsio/puppers-starter.git
cd puppers-starter
npm install
npm start
```

Running `npm start` will spin up a React server as well as a fake api

When the server starts up, you should see this:

![Front End](https://github.com/jeanpaulsio/puppers-starter/blob/master/screenshot1.png)

Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/dogs` and you should see this:

![Back End](https://github.com/jeanpaulsio/puppers-starter/blob/master/screenshot2.png)

## Front End

The front end runs on port `3000`

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

## Axios Examples

Fetching a resource:

```javascript
const { data } = await axios.get("http://localhost:4000/dogs")
```

Posting a resource:

```javascript
const { data } = await axios.post("http://localhost:4000/dogs", {
  name: this.state.newDog
})
```

## API Endpoints

The app comes with one resource - `dogs`

Feel free to create your own

Request:

```
GET http://localhost:4000/dogs
```

Response:

```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Benny"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Borgo"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Dewey"
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Percy"
  },
  {
    "id": 5,
    "name": "Peter"
  },
  {
    "id": 6,
    "name": "Pudge"
  },
  {
    "id": 7,
    "name": "Riggins"
  },
  {
    "id": 8,
    "name": "Doge"
  }
]
```

Request:

```
GET http://localhost:4000/dogs/1
```

Response:

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Benny"
}
```

## Adding Your Own Data

You can add whatever data you want by editing `api/db.json`

More comprehensive documentation can be read [here](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

Here we have a `dogs` resource:

```
{
  "dogs": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Doge"
    }
  ]
}
```

But what if we wanted to add an `owners` resource? How would we do that? Simple!

We can just append it like so:

```
{
  "dogs": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Doge"
    }
  ],
  "owners": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "JP"
    },
  ]
}
```

Cool. And what if I want to create a relationship between `owner` and `dog`?

I can do this:

```
{
  "dogs": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Doge"
      "ownerId": 1
    }
  ],
  "owners": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "JP"
    },
  ]
}
```

Note that `ownerId` uses camel case and corresponds to the `owners` resource. With this relationship set up, `json-server` automatically generates a few endpoints for us:

Request:

```
GET http://localhost:4000/owners/1/dogs
```

Response:

```
[
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Doge",
    ownerId: 1
  }
]
```

As well as

Request:

```
GET http://localhost:4000/owners/1?_embed=dogs
```

Response:

```
{
  id: 1,
  name: "jp",
  dogs: [
    {
      id: 1,
      name: "Doge",
      ownerId: 1
    }
  ]
}
```
