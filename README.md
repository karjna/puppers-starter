# Puppers üê∂

This app is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)

## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/jeanpaulsio/puppers-starter.git
cd puppers-starter
npm install
npm start
```

Running `npm start` will spin up a React server as well as a fake api

When the server starts up, you should see this:

Navigate to `http://localhost:4000/dogs` and you should see this:

![Back End](https://github.com/jeanpaulsio/puppers-starter/blob/master/screenshot2.png)

## Front End

The front end runs on port `3000`

```
http://localhost:3000/
```

## Axios Examples

Fetching a resource:

```javascript
const { data } = await axios.get("http://localhost:4000/dogs")
```

Posting a resource:

```javascript
const { data } = await axios.post("http://localhost:4000/dogs", {
  name: this.state.newDog
})
```

## API Endpoints

The app comes with one resource - `dogs`
